# Bitcoin-Multiple-Regression-Inference

### The aim of this analysis is to infer what variable affects bitcoin price the most, based on the size of coefficients of features which we include in our multiple regression model. The aim is certainly not to predict the bitcoin price, but we want to infer which features are massively associated with bitcoin price, what kind of relationship they have with it, and whether this relationship is simple or more complex (interaction/polynomial terms) To take this time series data and aim to predict bitcoin price with it, a detailed time series analysis will be followed in the future.Â¶
